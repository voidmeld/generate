## Rules

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before you change anything. It owns the code, documentation and integration rules.
The [API reference](docs/api.md) owns public signatures, returns and failures.

## Check your change

While you edit, run the fast checks with `lute run tools/gate.luau --tier fast`, or focus them with `--file <test file>` or `--name <text>`.
Commit the change, then run the full gate once on the clean HEAD with `lute run tools/gate.luau`.
